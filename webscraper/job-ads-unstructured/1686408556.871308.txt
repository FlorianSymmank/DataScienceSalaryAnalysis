Who We Are

We are an international team of young, engaged individuals who love to create professional photogrammetry software, turning cutting-edge research into value for our customers. Embracing a high diversity of skills and cultures, curiosity and an urge for excellence drive us. Municipalities and leading companies of the mapping industry use our unique technology for countrywide data production. We have built a strong reputation in the market—for us, this is just the beginning. Facing an evolving market and many fascinating challenges in technology, we need your expertise to help us get to the next level.

The Esri R&D center-Stuttgart develops the software technology SURE, which is used worldwide to reconstruct 3D surface models from images and lidar. As one of the leading solutions in this domain, it focuses on high accuracy and large-scale applications such as aerial mapping of entire cities and countries. The resulting data empowers various applications in areas such as smart cities, infrastructure, 5G planning, change detection, environment monitoring, cadaster mapping, or VR.

In our software development, we implement recent research from photogrammetry, computer vision, and machine learning into reality capture software. Our development language for the SURE engine is usually cross-platform C++ (CPU as well as GPU), as scalability and performance are important in our engineering work to be able to process massive datasets efficiently on workstations, computing clusters, or cloud infrastructures.

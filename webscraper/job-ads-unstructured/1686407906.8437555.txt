ABOUT US:
The engineering culture at wattx is shaped around principles of agile software development and user-centric design. We value pragmatism over idealism, simplicity over complexity, and technological agnosticism over fundamentalism, and we are seeking people who share these values. We stay ahead of the curve by using state-of-the-art tools and technologies.

wattx operates within Construction, Manufacturing, and Prop Tech, creating a real impact while focusing on Sustainability. We are a team of engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and venture developers. We identify opportunity areas and then conduct research and ideation sessions. Next, we prototype, vet, and develop the solutions that evolve from these sessions and develop them as projects with our parent company Viessmann and other clients from Mittelstand and our broad network of partners.

We screen all applications without regard to race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual identity, worldview, or disability. We do not require a photograph to be attached to the CV.

The mission of SafeAD is to solve the scalability problem of current
autonomous driving. Deploying autonomous driving in restricted areas is
cool, but the real value of autonomy comes when it is deployed around
the world and becomes accessible to everyone. We believe the key to
achieving this is 3D camera-based scene understanding that enables
mapless autonomous driving everywhere.

In this role, you’ll:

Develop tools to enable large scale ground truth data generation to train and test our ML models
Build up and integrate a simulation environment to test our software
Test our software in a self-driving vehicle
At a minimum we’d like you to have:

MSc/PhD in Computer Science, Robotics or equivalent experience
Experience in computer vision
Strong experience programming in C++ and Python
A strong team player and learning mindset
It’s preferred if you have:

Hands-on experience in the fields of autonomous driving
Experience in visual SLAM, sensor calibration, SfM, MVS, point cloud processing and optimization
Have worked in mid to large software projects
What we’ll offer you:

The chance to work on state-of-the-art computer vision for autonomous driving
A working place characterized by a flat hierarchy, quick processes and full focus on state-of-the-art technology
Flexible working hours
A competitive salary

The Helmholtz Centre Potsdam – GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences is the national centre for geosphere research. As a member of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres we are part of the largest scientific organization in Germany. With approximately 1,500 employees our key mission is to secure a profound understanding of the systems and processes of solid Earth, to develop strategies and options for action in addressing global change and its impacts on a regional level, to understand natural hazards and to minimize associated risks, to ensure the sustainable provision of energy and raw materials for a high-tech society and to evaluate the influence of human activity on system Earth.

For section 1.3 Earth System Modelling (department “Geodesy”), we are offering a:

PostDoc position (f_m_x) - Aggregation and exploration of large climate data sets

Reference Number 7806

We are searching for a PostDoc candidate to improve the usability of large climate data sets. The project will help to make future climate ensemble simulations more efficient by removing redundant information in a physically consistent way. The Earth System Modelling Section at GFZ is responsible for the development of numerical models of large-scale mass transport processes in the Earth’s geosphere. The successful candidate is expected to perform a wide range of numerical simulations as well as physically constrained data science and data analysis tasks.

Your responsibilities:
Develop physics based nonlinear aggregation of large climate model ensemble data
Design, execute, and evaluate scenarios to establish the limits of the aggregation method
Improve the robustness and usability of the aggregation method
Statistical analysis of residuals and forecast errors arising from deficits in the aggregation method and its application
Collaborative work in a highly interdisciplinary and international team
Presentation of your results at international conferences and project meetings
Publication of your results in international scientific journals
Your qualifications:
Master`s degree or equivalent and PhD degree in physics, meteorology, geosciences, or a related field
Strong skills in scientific programming with Python or R and Fortran
Experience with numerical Earth system models
Good command of English language

Start date: As soon as possible
Fixed-term: 24 months
Salary: The position is classed as salary group 13 according to “TVöD Bund (Tarifgebiet Ost)”. The salary group is determined on the basis of the Collective Wage Agreement and the respective personal qualifications.

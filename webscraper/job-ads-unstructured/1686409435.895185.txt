Veeva Systems is a mission-driven organization and pioneer in industry cloud, helping life sciences companies bring therapies to patients faster. As one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in history, we surpassed $2B in revenue in our last fiscal year with extensive growth potential ahead.
At the heart of Veeva are our values: Do the Right Thing, Customer Success, Employee Success, and Speed. We’re not just any public company – we made history in 2021 by becoming a public benefit corporation (PBC), legally bound to balancing the interests of customers, employees, society, and investors.
As a Work Anywhere company, we support your flexibility to work from home or in the office, so you can thrive in your ideal environment.
Join us in transforming the life sciences industry, committed to making a positive impact on its customers, employees, and communities.
The Role
Link is a pillar in the Veeva system landscape that envisions “Connecting life sciences and key people to improve research and care.” Our product offers real-time academics, social, and medical data to build comprehensive profiles. These profiles help our life-science industry partners find the right experts to accelerate the development and the adoption of new therapeutics. We accelerate clinical trials and equitable care. We are proud that our work helps patients receive their most urgent care sooner.
Your work will shape the product roadmap for the entire family of Link products, especially newer products such as Link for Trials. You will design and create an end-to-end pipeline to extract predefined categories of information from big unstructured data in multi-domain and multi-lingual setups. You will have access to cloud infrastructure to develop your model and support from a team of software developers and DevOps engineers to deploy it to production.
We want to develop new algorithms to redefine the industry expectations for quality vs. quantity compromise. We train ML models empowered by over 1900 curators to meet both the quality and the scale requirements. ML models complement and learn from continuous curation and scale our solutions to different regions, languages, and medical specialties.
We are hiring from both Germany and Netherlands. Alongside offices in Berlin and Frankfurt am Main, you can work remotely anywhere in those countries. However, you must live in those countries and be legally authorized to work there without requiring Veeva’s support for a visa or relocation. If you do not meet this condition but believe that you are an exceptional candidate, please clarify it in a separate document alongside your CV.

We're working with a world renowned music label based in Berlin looking for a Marketing Data Analyst to work on driving engagement for some major Artists & Labels. You'll be focusing on using the data to make better decisions when it comes to their marketing strategy.

The Role:
– Implement & Maintain a uniform marketing structure
– Increase marketing efficiency through being data driven
– Advise labels & marketing teams on best practice/good decision
– Use basic Python & SQL with AWS as their cloud (marketing is more important than tech here!)

This role is MUCH more focused on creating & proactively driving projects forward, they're looking for a true creative that understands the power of using data to make good decision (this is not a technical role, only mixes into it a bit!) You'll need to be completely fluent in German alongside English & have the ability to communicate with the C-Level & Artist/Celebrity in a clear & concise way.

If you're interested in this opportunity please reach out to myself directly:

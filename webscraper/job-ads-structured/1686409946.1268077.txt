A strong background either in high-performance computing or in numerical analysis. Knowledge of numerics as part of a degree program is an absolute must. Familiarity with iterative solvers, preconditioners, multigrid methods, and mixed-precision approaches is optional but extremely useful. Good programming skills and experience in C++ and its common programming idioms and design patterns. Knowledge of MATLAB, Python, Julia, or a similar scripting language is necessary for prototyping. Interest and affinity for high-performance computing. You should have experience with the roofline model and familiarity with a profiler. Experience with GPUs is a bonus. Fluency in written and spoken English. German language skills are not a prerequisite for the position.",
